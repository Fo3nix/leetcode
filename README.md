# Leetcode
In this repository I am adding all of my solutions to leetcode problems.

## Which problems?
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF554Tlzo-c This youtuber talks about a list of 150 leetcode problems you need to be ready for a job interview. --> https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-interview-questions/
2. Neetcode on youtube has made a roadmap for leetcode: neetcode.io. He has made a lot of video solutions too. Maybe this is a better one to follow.

## What will be in this repository?
I will make the solutions of the questions in the neetcode roadmap. 

## How do I solve these questions?
I will solve them on my own.
If I have no clue how to begin after 45-60 minutes, I will watch a solution video or seek another explanation. 
Then after knowing the solution I will still type it up, mostly on memory and when I get stuck I will rewatch parts of the video.

## GOAL
Solve medium problems in 20-30 minutes consistently.

## What to do after, or as another fun thing to do?
Do the 150 leetcode questions of number 1 of the '## which problems?'
